# Robot

**Starting HP:** 10  
**HP Per Repair:** d10 (Robots use Scrap to perform self-repair instead of resting)  
**Attack Damage:** d6 if Armed, d4 Unarmed or Improvising.

## Rolling Stats

Robots don’t roll stats, but instead generate their attribute stats with a point-buy system. They distribute 40 points between their four stats, one-for-one. Robots cannot have any stat below 2 or above 18.

## Modules

**Robots start the game with two Modules of their choice.** To use a Module, roll d6 under your Level. If you fail, mark a notch on your Level.  Once all three notches are marked, you can still use modules but if you fail the d6 test again, you shut down for a couple hours. The notches are cleared after running a thorough database diagnosis routine (rest). If you are trying to effect another character or attemt something difficult, roll an attribute test. Non-standard uses of a Module might have a disadvantage on their tests. If a roll of 20 is made while using a Module, the module shuts down temporarily, has the opposite effect, targets an ally, etc.

**Reactive Modules (R)** can be triggered in other characters' turns, and count as a free actions.

## Special features

**Mechanical:** Robots are immune to all poisons and radiation. They don’t require air, food, water or sleep.  
**Black box:** Robots can be restored and their bodies rebuilt. Find a body or build a new one using 4+Level Scrap. Choose attributes and Modules.

## Leveling up

Spend 1+Level XP and the same amount of Scrap to level up and

- Add 5 to your Max HP.
- Distribute two points between your attributes.
- Gain a Module of choice to a maximum of four. When gaining a fifth module, that one replaces an old one.
