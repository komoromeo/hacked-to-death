## Creature HDs

HD represents an enemyâ€™s level and the number of d8 rolled to determine its HP. Dead bodies can be turned into Fresh Food (or Scrap if mechanical) equal to their HD. Starting players are roughly equivalent to a 2HD creature.

| HD   | Damage |
| ---- | ------ |
| 1    | d4     |
| 2    | d6     |
| 3    | d8     |
| 4    | d10    |
| 5    | d12    |
| 6    | 2d8    |



## Creature reactions

Some creatures and NPCs will have predetermined personalities and goals that will guide a GM when choosing their actions and feelings towards the characters. Those that do not, such as randomly encountered creatures, make a d8 Reaction roll on the following table:

| 1d8  | REACTION                     |
| :--- | :--------------------------- |
| 1    | Flee then roll again.        |
| 2    | Avoid the PCs entirely.      |
| 3    | Trade with PCs.              |
| 4    | Give the PCs aid.            |
| 5    | Mistake the PCs for friends. |
| 6    | Trick the PCs (roll again).  |
| 7    | Call for Reinforcements.     |
| 8    | Capture/Kill/Eat the PCs.    |
