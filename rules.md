# The RAD-Hack: Hacked to death

*Based on* **The Black Hack** *by* **David Black** and **The RAD-Hack** by **Kark Stjernberg**.

# Basics

**The Rad-Hack** is a tabletop roleplaying game, set in an atomic wasteland where mutants, machines and marauders roam the charred earth trying to survive. It is played with paper, pencils, some dice and a hefty dose of imagination.

## The core mechanic

Whenever a character tries to do something that is risky and could result in a failure, you test the character's most relevant attribute:

- **Stamina (STAM)** for physical tasks and against Physical Harm that *cannot* be dodged, Poison, Disease, Radiation or Death.
- **Instinct (INST)** for awareness, reflexes and against Physical Harm that *can* be dodged.
- **Knowledge (KNOW)** for intelligence, willpower and against Psionic abilities and mind control effects.
- **Prestige (PRES)** for charisma and against charming effects and bad reactions.

**To make a test, you must roll below the attribute on a d20.** Enemies donâ€™t make tests - a character must avoid their attacks or harmful effects by making a test. The only time a Game Master (GM) would roll is for damage. A roll of 1 is always a critical success with extra benefical effects and a roll of 20 is always a critical failure with extra harmful effects.

## Advantage & Disadvantage

The Game Master may decide that a particular course of action or task has a higher or lower chance of success. **Roll two dice instead of one and keep one, with advantage the Player chooses and with disadvantage the GM chooses which one.** Most of these advantaged and disadvantaged rolls will be attribute tests but occasionally it might be other rolls.

## Notches

Some things will reduce in quality or quantity over time or increase in severity. Whenever this happens, mark a Notch next to the thing, be it an Item,  Radiation, an Ability or whatever. The maximum number of notches is three. Having all three notches marked on something will have an often detrimental effect like item breakage, ability depletion, radiation effects.

# Characters

## Creating a character

You will need to fill someone's shoes and impersonate them, interacting with the world through them.

1. **Chosing a class:** There are 4 classes to play as and choose from: **Human**, **Mutant**, **Psych** and **Robot**. Your class determines how much damage you do, your Hit Points and unique abilities.
2. **Rolling stats:** Stats are generated differently depending on which class the player character belongs to.
3. **Rolling equipment:** Every new character rolls for starting gear on the Starting Gear table. Characters also start with a set of dirty clothes or their own description and other equipment listed in their class description.

## Recording your character

The information about your character should be recorded on a character sheet. This sheet should contain:

- The character's **Name, Class and Level**,
- Their **Attributes, Damage Dice, Hit Points and Armor Points**,
- **Special Features** and **Profession, Mutations, Powers or Modules**.
- Their **Inventory** with their gear.
- Space for conditions like **Hunger, Thirst and Radiation**, unless you are a robot.
- Some extra space for notes.

## Starting gear

**Roll twice!** If you don't have enough inventory slots for all of these, tough luck.

| d8   | Starting Gear      |
| ---- | ------------------ |
| 1    | d6 Slugs           |
| 2    | Light Melee Weapon |
| 3    | d4 Scraps          |
| 4    | d6 Junk            |
| 5    | Tech               |
| 6    | d4 Preserved Food  |
| 7    | d4 Clean Water     |
| 8    | d4 Random Drugs    |

## Experience & Levels

Experience Points (XP) are used to advance your character. You gain experience

You gain experience the first time you

- Lay someone to rest.
- Drop to 0 HP and live to fight another day.

You gain experience each time you

- Thoroughly investigate a place.
- Defeat a major enemy
- Reach a major personal or group goal

Every character starts at Level 1. **You need to spend 1+Level XP to level up.** When a character levels up, roll the Hit Dice listed for the class and increase the character's Hit Points by the result. A player should also roll a d20 for each Stat. If the result is higher, that Stat increases by 1. The maximum level a character can advance to is 6.

----

# Gear

Equipment can be found throughout the world but can also be bought at settlements and wandering traders.

## Encumbrance

**A character can carry a number of items equal to their STAM with no issues.** Carrying more than this amount means they are encumbered and all attribute tests are rolled with Disadvantage - you can also only ever move to somewhere Nearby. A character simply cannot carry more than double their STAM.

## Slugs

Slugs are the standard currency. All prices are given in slugs. You can buy items for the listed price and sell them for half the listed price, rounded down. Slugs are also used as ammunition for most standard firearms.

## Equipment quality & degradation

When rolling an attack roll of 20 with a weapon, mark a Notch on the weapon. When rolling a 20 on a defensive roll, mark a Notch on each of your armor pieces that you wear. Depending on the equipment, it can be repaired by using Scrap or Junk and testing KNOW. A successful test removes one Notch for each Scrap/Junk used. Whenever equipment is used in ways that could harm it, test if you should mark a notch.

|  d6  | Notches - Quality | Cost |
| :--: | :---------------: | :--: |
|  -   |  III - Destroyed  |  0   |
| 1-2  |    II - Shitty    | 1/3  |
| 3-5  |    I - Alright    | 2/3  |
|  6   |     0 - Good      | Full |

## Junk & Garbage

Most things you scavenge are Junk. Junk might be useful in certain situations. A character can find a fair amount of junk lying around.

Garbage is worthless stuff. What counts as worthless varies by person. When you try to sell something, you might find that something is worth less for some traders. For a pacifist a weapon might be junk or even garbage, for example. You can't sell stuff for more than its listed price, unless the other party is really desperate.

When characters loot a room or scavenge for supplies in the wilderness, they will often find junk. The GM will not always specify the type of junk found. In these cases the players can make up what they find. What they find should still make sense. In a bathroom you can find a mop, a bucket, a roll of toilet paper but you won't find plants or tires.

## Armor

Armor provides protection by reducing all incoming damage. **Each Armor Point (AP) will reduce damage by 1.** Immediately after a fight where armor has been used to reduce damage, test quality or mark a notch on the item. Once, 3 notches are marked, the armor is considered destroyed and doesn't provide benefits anymore. Armor can be repaired, however.  The players are encouraged to describe the kind of armor the characters are wearing and what it's made of.

| Clothes and Armor | Cost |  AP  | Example                                                      |

# Combat

## Time

Usually time is free-flowing, befitting the narrative, but sometimes it is more structured like in combat. When tis happens, time is divided into Rounds and Turns. Multiple turns make up a round. A Round is a short time when every character in a scene has a chance to act, a round usually lasts for a couple seconds. A turn is one character's slice of time in a round, when they can act.

## Initiative

When combat breaks out, every PC tests their INST, those that succeed, take their turn before their opponents, those that fail, go after their opponents. The characters acting in the same gropup decide their own order of actions for themselves. Initiative is rolled only at the beginning of combat but the groups can choose their own order of actions each round.

## Actions & Movement

**During a playerâ€™s turn a character may perform one action.** interacting with the world is an action: attacking, looking for a clue, talking with an NPC, disarming a trap. Often they will test their attributes to determine the outcome.

Rather than track precise numbers, The Rad-Hack uses 3 abstract ranges for measuring distances: **Close, Nearby and Far Away**.  These are around 3, 15 and 30 meters, respectively. **On their turn every character can move somewhere Close as part of an action**, performing that action at any stage of the move. **They can forgo their action and move somewhere Nearby instead.** Anything beyond Nearby can be classified as Far Away and would take multiple turns to get to.

## Attacking, defending & damage

When a character attacks an enemy, they must test their STAM for a Melee Attack or INST for a Ranged Attack. When an enemy attacks, the character must roll below her STAM against a Melee Attack and INST against a Ranged Attack to avoid taking damage. A succesful attack deals damage based on a characterâ€™s class or the number of HD an enemy has. To make a Melee Attack an opponent must be Close. Ranged Attacks are usually made against Nearby opponents. Against Close and Far Away opponents, Ranged Attacks are at a Disadvantage.

## Critical damage

If a player rolls a 1 when making an attack roll, the attack counts as a critical hit and they can roll twice for damage. Likewise, if they roll a 20 when avoiding an attack, they instead take double damage from the enemy. Armor Points are used normally. Donâ€™t forget to mark a notch on the weapon and armor.

## Hit Points

Characters can regain lost Hit Points from Resting, Herbs, Drugs, Abilities and in the case of Robot characters, by being repaired. They can never gain more than their maximum and can never go below zero.

## Death & dying

When an NPC drops to 0 HP, they die or are otherwise incapacitated. When a PC drops to 0 HP, they are knocked unconscious for a couple hours and may also suffer additional consequences.

**If the character is a Human, Mutant or Psych roll on the Left for Dead table, if the character is a Robot, roll on the Left for Scraps table.** Be creative with interpreting and describing the results.

|  d8  | Left for Dead                                                | Left for Scraps                                              |
| :--: | :----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  1   | Bruises - You got off easy this time.                        | Scratches - You got off easy this time.                      |
|  2   | Concussion - All stats are -2 for the next day.              | Concussion - All stats are -2 for the next day.              |
|  3   | Organ Damage - STAM and INST are -2 for the next 1d6 days.   | Offline - A random module is unusable until your next repair when you forgo healing. |
|  4   | Cracked Skull - RESO and REPU are -2 for the next 1d6 days.  | System Failure - All stats are -2 until your next repair when you forgo healing. |
| 5-6  | Crippling Injury - Random stat is permanently reduced by 2.  | Malfunction - A random module is lost permanently.           |
| 7-8  | Grisly Death - Spectacularly eviscerated, blown up, melted, smashed into jelly etc. | Salvage - Your body is destroyed and can be turned into 1d4 Srap. Roll 1d4. On a 1, your Black Box is destroyed, otherwise it's intact. |

# Exploration

## Traveling & Resting

The world map is constructed of zones. Usually such a zone is a hexagonal tiles that is 12 miles/20 kilometers across. Expect to encounter creatures or locations on your travels.

A day is made up of four 6-hour watches. Two of these watches are in the nighttime, two in the daytime. When entering a new watch, roll for encounter, if applicable.

Use each watch for one of the following:

- **Wait** for the time to pass. Do some crafting or shit.
- **Explore** the zone you currently reside in. Reveal a location.
- **Forage** for loot, supplies, food and water. 
- **Investigate** a revealed location.
- **Rest** and clear all the notches on your Level. Once per day, you can roll the Hit Die associated with your class and regain that many HP. Substract any Hunger and Thirst Notches.
- **Travel** to an adjacent zone. Reveal a location.

## Hunger & Thirst

**When starting a new day, eat and drink.** If you don't eat, pass a STAM test or Mark a Hunger Notch. If you don't drink, mark a Thirst Notch. If you have three notches and would mark a fourth one, you die. Consume one food to clear a Hunger notch and one water to clear a Thirst Notch. When you don't have Notches, consume food or water to heal 1 HP.

Eating contaminated food and drinking contaminated water might result in bad stuff happening.

## Radiation

When you approach a zone that is glowing from radiation, roll STAM, if you fail, mark a Notch on your Radiation. Once you gained three notches, roll on the Radiation Effects Table. These radiation effects persist until treated. Certain drugs and tech mitigate the effects of radiation.

Depending on how close you are to the source of the glow and the level of radiation, roll more or less often - **Low** 1/day, **Moderate** 1/hour, **High** 1/minute, **Extreme** 1/round.

| 1d8  | Radiation Effects                                            |
| :--- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Glowing - Take d6 damage and gain a random mutation.         |
| 2    | Nausea - Take d6 damage and disadvantage on INST tests.      |
| 3    | Stinging - Take d8 damage.                                   |
| 4    | Burning - Take d12 damage.                                   |
| 5    | Headache - Take d6 damage and disadvantage on all RESO tests. |
| 6    | Melting - You melt into a glowing, horrible mess and die.    |

## Poisons

Poisons come in many different forms and can cause a wide variety of effects on the victim. Most poisons will require a passed STAM test to resist and/or neutralize. See table below for examples of poisons:

| TYPE           | EFFECT                               |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| Hematoxin      | Victim takes d6 damage every Minute. |
| Hallucinogenic | Victim hallucinates for 1 hour.      |
| Neurotoxin     | Disadvantage on INST and RESO tests. |
| Paralyzing     | Lose ability to move.                |

## Creature reactions

Some creatures and NPCs will have predetermined personalities and goals that will guide a GM when choosing their actions and feelings towards the characters. Those that do not, such as randomly encountered creatures, make a d8 Reaction roll on the following table:

| 1d8  | REACTION                     |
| :--- | :--------------------------- |
| 1    | Flee then roll again.        |
| 2    | Avoid the PCs entirely.      |
| 3    | Trade with PCs.              |
| 4    | Give the PCs aid.            |
| 5    | Mistake the PCs for friends. |
| 6    | Trick the PCs (roll again).  |
| 7    | Call for Reinforcements.     |
| 8    | Capture/Kill/Eat the PCs.    |
