# Combat

## Time & Initiative

Usually time is free-flowing, befitting the narrative, but sometimes it is more structured, like in combat. When tis happens, time is divided into Rounds and Turns. Multiple turns make up a round. A Round is a short time when every character in a scene has a chance to act, a round usually lasts for a minute. A turn is one character's slice of time in a round, when they can act.

When combat breaks out, every PC tests their INST, those that succeed, take their turn before their opponents, those that fail, go after their opponents. The characters acting in the same gropup decide their own order of actions for themselves. Initiative is rolled only at the beginning of combat but the groups can choose their own order of actions each round.

## Actions & Movement

**During a playerâ€™s turn a character may perform one action.** Interacting with the world is an action: attacking, looking for a clue, disarming a trap.

Most distances are given in abstract ranges. These are around 3, 15 and 30 meters, respectively. The ranges are:

- **Close.** On their turn every character can move somewhere Close as part of an action, performing that action at any stage of the move.
- **Nearby.** They can forgo their action and move somewhere Nearby instead.
- **Far Away.** Anything beyond Nearby can be classified as Far Away and would take multiple turns to get to.

When a character moves towards or away from something, they are shifted into the next distance category.<!--This is new, from TBH 2e-->

On a large scale, the same distance names are used as in a small scale. In a day, the party can move somewhere close and perform an action (like exploring a location or foraging) or forgo their action and move somewhere nearby.

Each day, roll for encounter.

Night is for resting?

## Damage & Death

When a creature attacks another, they roll the damage die associated with their weapon or HD. To make a Melee Attack an opponent must be Close. Ranged Attacks are usually made against Nearby opponents but can be made against Close and Far Away opponents at a Disadvantage.

A creature can suffer damage from enemies and environmental effects. Each point of damage taken counts against the creature's STAM or health. Once the damage reaches or surpasses this threshold, extras are dead or incapacitated. Characters are knocked out and if they are not taken to a safe space to recover, they die. If they are, they roll for consequences on the **Trauma** table. Be creative with interpreting and describing the results.

|  d6  | Trauma           | Effect                                                       |
| :--: | :--------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  1   | Bruises          | You got off easy this time.                                  |
|  2   | Concussion       | -2 to all stats for the next day.                            |
|  3   | Organ Damage     | -2 to STAM and INST for the next 1d6 days.                   |

Characters can heal and erase damage by resting, drugs and abilities. Rest and gain 1d10 Health.

## Madness & Drugs

A creature from suffer madness from drugs, scary stuff and psychic effects. Madness counts against your COMP the same way damage counts against your STAM. Once a creature's madness is equal to or more than their COMP or health, they roll on the **Psychosis** table.<!--ideas from last gasp, also: phobias, amnesia, revelations-->

| d6   | Psychosis        | Effect                                                       |

| 1    | Catharsis        | Permanent +1 to COMP.<!--maybe temporary, maybe a psych power--> |
| 2    |                  |                                                              |
| 3    | Shaken           | Nothing serious.                                             |
| 4    |                  |                                                              |
| 5    | Brain Damage     | Permanent -1 to random stat.                                 |
| 6    | Vegetable/Stupor | Any action more complex than drooling is impossible for you. |
