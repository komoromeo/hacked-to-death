# Combat

## Time

Usually time is free-flowing, befitting the narrative, but sometimes it is more structured like in combat. When tis happens, time is divided into Rounds and Turns. Multiple turns make up a round. A Round is a short time when every character in a scene has a chance to act, a round usually lasts for a couple seconds. A turn is one character's slice of time in a round, when they can act.

## Initiative

When combat breaks out, every PC tests their INST, those that succeed, take their turn before their opponents, those that fail, go after their opponents. The characters acting in the same gropup decide their own order of actions for themselves. Initiative is rolled only at the beginning of combat but the groups can choose their own order of actions each round.

## Actions & Movement

**During a player’s turn a character may perform one action.** interacting with the world is an action: attacking, looking for a clue, talking with an NPC, disarming a trap. Often they will test their attributes to determine the outcome.

Rather than track precise numbers, The Rad-Hack uses 3 abstract ranges for measuring distances: **Close, Nearby and Far Away**.  These are around 3, 15 and 30 meters, respectively. **On their turn every character can move somewhere Close as part of an action**, performing that action at any stage of the move. **They can forgo their action and move somewhere Nearby instead.** Anything beyond Nearby can be classified as Far Away and would take multiple turns to get to.

## Attacking, defending & damage

When a character attacks an enemy, they must test their STAM for a Melee Attack or INST for a Ranged Attack. When an enemy attacks, the character must roll below her STAM against a Melee Attack and INST against a Ranged Attack to avoid taking damage. A succesful attack deals damage based on a character’s class or the number of HD an enemy has. To make a Melee Attack an opponent must be Close. Ranged Attacks are usually made against Nearby opponents. Against Close and Far Away opponents, Ranged Attacks are at a Disadvantage.

## Critical damage

If a player rolls a 1 when making an attack roll, the attack counts as a critical hit and they can roll twice for damage. Likewise, if they roll a 20 when avoiding an attack, they instead take double damage from the enemy. Armor Points are used normally. Don’t forget to mark a notch on the weapon and armor.

## Hit Points

Characters can regain lost Hit Points from Resting, Herbs, Drugs, Abilities and in the case of Robot characters, by being repaired. They can never gain more than their maximum and can never go below zero.

## Death & dying

When an NPC drops to 0 HP, they die or are otherwise incapacitated. When a PC drops to 0 HP, they are knocked unconscious for a couple hours and may also suffer additional consequences.

**If the character is a Human, Mutant or Psych roll on the Left for Dead table, if the character is a Robot, roll on the Left for Scraps table.** Be creative with interpreting and describing the results.
