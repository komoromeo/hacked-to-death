<!--What is this game-->

Players play characters and the game master impersonates the world and extras. Extras are non-player-characters.

## The core mechanic

Whenever a character tries to do something that is risky and could result in a failure, you test the character's most relevant statistic. These stats each have a score, this score can't get lower than 2 or higher than 16. The stats are:

- **STAM** or stamina for physical tasks and against Poison, Disease, Radiation or Death. Health and Load bearing capacity are also based on this.
- **INST** or instinct for awareness and reflexes.
- **COMP** or comprehension for intelligence, willpower and against mind control effects.
- **CRED** or credibility for charisma and against charming effects and bad reactions.

**To make a test, you must roll below the stat on a d20.** Evtras donâ€™t make tests - a character makes one instead, if they interact. A roll of 1 is always a critical success with extra benefical effects and a roll of 20 is always a critical failure with extra harmful effects.

## Advantage & Disadvantage

The Game Master may decide that a particular course of action or task has a higher or lower chance of success. **Roll two dice instead of one and keep one, with advantage the Player chooses and with disadvantage the GM chooses which one.** Most of these advantaged and disadvantaged rolls will be attribute tests but occasionally it might be other rolls.
