# The RAD-Hack: Hacked to death

*Based on* **The Black Hack** *by* **David Black** and **The RAD-Hack** by **Kark Stjernberg**.

# Basics

**The Rad-Hack** is a tabletop roleplaying game, set in an atomic wasteland where mutants, machines and marauders roam the charred earth trying to survive. It is played with paper, pencils, some dice and a hefty dose of imagination.

## The core mechanic

Whenever a character tries to do something that is risky and could result in a failure, you test the character's most relevant statistic. These stats each have a score, this score can't get lower than 2 or higher than 16. The stats are:

- **Stamina (STAM)** for physical tasks and against Physical Harm that *cannot* be dodged, Poison, Disease, Radiation or Death.
- **Instinct (INST)** for awareness, reflexes and against Physical Harm that *can* be dodged.
- **Knowledge (KNOW)** for intelligence, willpower and against Psionic abilities and mind control effects.
- **Prestige (PRES)** for charisma and against charming effects and bad reactions.

**To make a test, you must roll below the stat on a d20.** Enemies donâ€™t make tests - a character must avoid their attacks or harmful effects by making a test. The only time a Game Master (GM) would roll is for damage. A roll of 1 is always a critical success with extra benefical effects and a roll of 20 is always a critical failure with extra harmful effects.

## Advantage & Disadvantage

The Game Master may decide that a particular course of action or task has a higher or lower chance of success. **Roll two dice instead of one and keep one, with advantage the Player chooses and with disadvantage the GM chooses which one.** Most of these advantaged and disadvantaged rolls will be attribute tests but occasionally it might be other rolls.

## Notches

Some things will reduce in quality or quantity over time or increase in severity. Whenever this happens, mark a Notch next to the thing, be it an Item,  Radiation, an Ability or whatever. The maximum number of notches is three. Having all three notches marked on something will have an often detrimental effect like item breakage, ability depletion, radiation effects.
