# Mutant

**Starting HP:** d6+4  
**HP Per Resting:** 1d6  
**Attack Damage:** d6 if Armed, d4 if Unarmed or Improvising.

## Rolling Stats

Mutants roll a single d20 for each stat in order. Reroll all results of 1 and 20.

## Mutations

**Mutants start the game with two randomly chosen Mutations.** To use a Mutation, roll d6 under your Level. If you fail, mark a notch on your Level.  Once all three notches are marked, you can't use Mutations until you rest. The notches are cleared after resting. If you are trying to effect another character or attemt something difficult, roll an attribute test. Non-standard uses of a Mutation might have a disadvantage on their tests. If a roll of 20 is made while using a Mutation, the module shuts down temporarily, has the opposite effect, targets an ally, etc.

**Reactive Mutations (R)** can be triggered in other characters' turns, and count as a free actions.

## Special features

**Adaptive:** Upon leveling up, a Mutant can swap two attributes around.  
**Used to the Glow**: Mutants roll with advantage to resist radiation.
