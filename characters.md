# Characters

## Creating a character

You will need to fill someone's shoes and impersonate them, interacting with the world through them. You will need to choose a class for your character first and then follow the instructions given for starting out with that class. The three classes are: **Human**, **Mutant** and **Psych**. If you are unsure, read the class descriptions first.

<!--you can spice shit up by rolling on the returning characters table for first characters.-->

## Recording your character

The information about your character should be recorded on a character sheet. This sheet should contain:<!--needs update-->

- The character's **Name, Class and Level**,

- **Special Features** and **Profession, Mutations, or Powers**.
- Their **Inventory** with their gear.
- Space for conditions like **Hunger and Radiation**.
- Some extra space for notes.
