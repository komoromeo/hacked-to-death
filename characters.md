# Characters

## Creating a character

You will need to fill someone's shoes and impersonate them, interacting with the world through them.

1. **Chosing a class:** There are 4 classes to play as and choose from: **Human**, **Mutant**, **Psych** and **Robot**. Your class determines how much damage you do, your Hit Points and unique abilities.
2. **Rolling stats:** Stats are generated differently depending on which class the player character belongs to.
3. **Rolling equipment:** Every new character rolls for starting gear on the Starting Gear table. Characters also start with a set of dirty clothes or their own description and other equipment listed in their class description.

## Recording your character

The information about your character should be recorded on a character sheet. This sheet should contain:

- The character's **Name, Class and Level**,
- Their **Stats, Damage Dice, Hit Points and Armor Points**,
- **Special Features** and **Profession, Mutations, Powers or Modules**.
- Their **Inventory** with their gear.
- Space for conditions like **Hunger, Thirst and Radiation**, unless you are a robot.
- Some extra space for notes.

## Starting gear

**Roll twice!** If you don't have enough inventory slots for all of these, tough luck. Read up on these items in the Gear section.

## Experience & Levels

Experience Points (XP) are used to advance your character. You gain experience

You gain experience the first time you

- Lay someone to rest.
- Drop to 0 HP and live to fight another day.

You gain experience each time you

- Thoroughly investigate a place.
- Defeat a major enemy
- Reach a major personal or group goal

Every character starts at Level 1. **You need to spend 1+Level XP to level up.** When a character levels up, roll the Hit Dice listed for the class and increase the character's Hit Points by the result. The maximum level a character can advance to is 6.
