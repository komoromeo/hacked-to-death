# Mutant

A mutant is a sentient organism -- plant, fungus, animal, human or other -- that became heavily mutatet thanks to the radiation tainting the wasteland.

## Starting out

1. **Stats:** Roll a d12+4 for each stat in order. Once all stats are generated, 2 may be swapped around.
2. **Starting mutations:** Roll for two mutatoins on the Mutations table.
3. **Special features:**
   - Mutants roll to resist rasdiation with advantage. <!--could be a radiation table-->
4. **Starting gear:**
   - d4 preserved food
   - d4 fresh food
   - d4 junk
   - dirty clothes

## Leveling Up

Spend 1+Level XP and the same amount of food to level up and:

- Gain a random Mutation each level, to a max of five. After five, any new ones replaces an old one.
- Optionally, swap the scores of two stats around.

## Mutations

Mutations are the result of some genetic mishap. If you are trying to effect another character or attemt something difficult, test a relevant stat. Non-standard uses of a Mutation might have a disadvantage on their tests. If a roll of 20 is made while using a Mutation, it has the opposite effect, targets an ally, etc.
