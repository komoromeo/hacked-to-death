# Psych

**Starting HP:** d4+4  
**HP Per Resting:** d4  
**Attack Damage:** d4 if Armed, 1 if Unarmed or Improvising.

## Rolling Stats

Psychs roll 3d6 for each stat in order. Once all stats are generated, 2 may be swapped around.

## Psionic powers

**Psychs start the game with two randomly selected Powers.** To use a Power, roll d6 under your Level. If you fail, mark a notch on your Level.  Once all three notches are marked, you can still use modules but if you fail the d6 test again, you black out for a couple hours. The notches are cleared after rresting. If you are trying to effect another character or attemt something difficult, roll an attribute test. Non-standard uses of a Power might have a disadvantage on their tests. If a roll of 20 is made while using a Power, the module shuts down temporarily, has the opposite effect, targets an ally, etc.

**Reactive Powers (R)** can be triggered in other characters' turns, and count as a free actions.

## Special features

**Mental Fortitude:** Roll with Advantage when testing to avoid damage or effects from psionic sources.  
**Eat Brains:** When you eat the brain of another psychic, you have a chance of gaining some of their abilities.
