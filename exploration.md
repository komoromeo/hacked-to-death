# Exploration

## Foraging

Foraging for loot, supplies, food and water.

You are encouraged to switch paricular entries or the whole table.

## Hunger

If you don't eat for a day, gain one hunger. **Substract all the hunger from healing rolls.** Consume one food to reduce hunger by one. If you are not hungry, consume food to heal 1 health.

Thirst is abstracted away and characters are assumed to find water to drink.

Eating contaminated food might result in bad stuff happening.

## Radiation

When you approach a zone that is glowing from radiation, roll STAM, if you fail, gain one radiation. **Each radiation reduces your max health by 1.** If you roll a 1, you get disadvantage on all RESO tests. If you roll a 20, gain a random mutation. These radiation effects persist until treated. Some drugs and tech provide protection from radiation, others cure the effects. Depending on how close you are to the source of the glow and the strength of the radiation, roll more or less often: every day, every hour or every minute.

## Poisons

Poisons come in many different forms and can cause a wide variety of effects on the victim. Most poisons will require a STAM test to resist or neutralize. Some poisons:

| Poison           | Effect                               |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| Hematoxin      | Victim takes d6 damage every Minute. |
| Hallucinogenic | Victim hallucinates for 1 hour.      |
| Neurotoxin     | Disadvantage on INST and RESO tests. |
| Paralyzing     | Lose ability to move.                |

## Returning players

When a player misses one or more sessions, their character returns with consequences, one asset and one setback. They can choose one and they must roll the other.
