# Exploration

## Traveling & Resting

A day is made up of four 24 hours. Daytime and nighttime are 12 hours each. Roll a d6 at the start of each hour. If you roll a 1, an encounter happens.

The world map is constructed of zones. Traveling to an adjacent zone takes one hour. Expect to find locations.

Foraging for loot, supplies, food and water.

<!--Comment for foraging and encounter tables: you are encouraged to switch paricular entries or the whole table-->

## Hunger & Thirst

Rest and clear all the notches on your level. Once per day, you can roll the Hit Die associated with your class and regain that many health.

<!--Substract any hunger and thirst from healing? If you're either hungry or thirsty, do not heal, if you are both, you lose health at the start of each day.-->

If you don't eat for a day, gain one hunger. If you don't drink for a day, gain one thirst. **Each hunger reduces your max health by 1 and each thirst reduces it by 2.** Consume one food to clear a hunger and one water to clear a thirst. If you are neither hungry nor thirsty, consume food or water to heal 1 HP.

Eating contaminated food and drinking contaminated water might result in bad stuff happening.

## Radiation

When you approach a zone that is glowing from radiation, roll STAM, if you fail, gain one radiation. **Each radiation reduces your max health by 1.** If you roll a 1, you get disadvantage on all RESO tests. If you roll a 20, gain a random mutation. These radiation effects persist until treated. Sme drugs and tech provide protection from radiation, others cure the effects. Depending on how close you are to the source of the glow and the strength of the radiation, roll more or less often: every day, every hour or every minute.

## Poisons

Poisons come in many different forms and can cause a wide variety of effects on the victim. Most poisons will require a passed STAM test to resist and/or neutralize. See table below for examples of poisons:

| Poison           | Effect                               |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------- |

| Hallucinogenic | Victim hallucinates for 1 hour.      |
| Neurotoxin     | Disadvantage on INST and RESO tests. |
| Paralyzing     | Lose ability to move.                |

## Returning players

When a player misses one or more sessions, their character returns with consequences, one asset and one setback. They can choose one and they must roll the other.
