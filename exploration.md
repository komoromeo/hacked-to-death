# Exploration

## Traveling & Resting

The world map is constructed of zones. Usually such a zone is a hexagonal tiles that is 12 miles/20 kilometers across. Expect to encounter creatures or locations on your travels.

A day is made up of four 6-hour watches. Two of these watches are in the nighttime, two in the daytime. When entering a new watch, roll for encounter, if applicable.

Use each watch for one of the following:

- **Wait** for the time to pass. Do some crafting or shit.
- **Explore** the zone you currently reside in. Reveal a location.
- **Forage** for loot, supplies, food and water. 
- **Investigate** a revealed location.
- **Rest** and clear all the notches on your Level. Once per day, you can roll the Hit Die associated with your class and regain that many HP. Substract any Hunger and Thirst Notches.
- **Travel** to an adjacent zone. Reveal a location.

## Hunger & Thirst

**When starting a new day, eat and drink.** If you don't eat, pass a STAM test or Mark a Hunger Notch. If you don't drink, mark a Thirst Notch. If you have three notches and would mark a fourth one, you die. Consume one food to clear a Hunger notch and one water to clear a Thirst Notch. When you don't have Notches, consume food or water to heal 1 HP.

Eating contaminated food and drinking contaminated water might result in bad stuff happening.

## Radiation

When you approach a zone that is glowing from radiation, roll STAM, if you fail, mark a Notch on your Radiation. Once you gained three notches, roll on the Radiation Effects Table. These radiation effects persist until treated. Certain drugs and tech mitigate the effects of radiation.

Depending on how close you are to the source of the glow and the level of radiation, roll more or less often - **Low** 1/day, **Moderate** 1/hour, **High** 1/minute, **Extreme** 1/round.

| 1d8  | Radiation Effects                                            |
| :--- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Glowing - Take d6 damage and gain a random mutation.         |
| 2    | Nausea - Take d6 damage and disadvantage on INST tests.      |
| 3    | Stinging - Take d8 damage.                                   |
| 4    | Burning - Take d12 damage.                                   |
| 5    | Headache - Take d6 damage and disadvantage on all RESO tests. |
| 6    | Melting - You melt into a glowing, horrible mess and die.    |

## Poisons

Poisons come in many different forms and can cause a wide variety of effects on the victim. Most poisons will require a passed STAM test to resist and/or neutralize. See table below for examples of poisons:

| TYPE           | EFFECT                               |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| Hematoxin      | Victim takes d6 damage every Minute. |
| Hallucinogenic | Victim hallucinates for 1 hour.      |
| Neurotoxin     | Disadvantage on INST and RESO tests. |
| Paralyzing     | Lose ability to move.                |

## Creature reactions

Some creatures and NPCs will have predetermined personalities and goals that will guide a GM when choosing their actions and feelings towards the characters. Those that do not, such as randomly encountered creatures, make a d8 Reaction roll on the following table:

| 1d8  | REACTION                     |
