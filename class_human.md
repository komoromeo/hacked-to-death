# Human

A human is mostly genetically identical to its species before the End and lacks any serious mutations.

## Starting out

To make a human, follow these steps:

1. **Stats:** Roll 2d6+3 five times and discard the lowest roll. Then assign each of the remaining four numbers to a stat.
2. **Starting background:** Roll for a background on the Background table.
3. **Special features:**
   - Humans roll on the Trauma table with advantage.
   - Once per day, a human can reroll a scavenging roll.
4. **Starting gear:**
   - the starting gear for your background
   - d4 preserved food
   - d6 junk
   - dirty clothes

## Leveling up

Spend 1+Level XP to level up and:

- Add 1 to an optional stat.
- Change the background to something else, if it fits the fiction.

## Backgrounds

The background is what the character was before they started adventuring. A background provides some extra starting equipment and advantage on relevant tests.
