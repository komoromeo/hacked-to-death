# Gear

Useful items can be found throughout the world but can also be bought from traders or crafted.

## Encumbrance

**A character can carry a number of items equal to their Max Health with no issues.** Carrying more than this amount means they are encumbered and all stat tests are rolled with Disadvantage - you can also only ever move to somewhere Nearby. A character simply cannot carry more than double their Max Health.

## Slugs

**Slugs are ammunition for firearms and also the standard currency.** All prices are given in slugs. You can mostly buy items for the listed price and sell for the same if you find a buyer. Bartering is common. Remember, one shot with a pistol is one day's worth of food.

## Junk & Garbage

Most things you scavenge are Junk. Junk might be useful in certain situations. A character can find a fair amount of junk lying around.

Garbage is worthless stuff. What counts as worthless varies by person. When you try to sell something, you might find that something is worth less for some traders. For a pacifist a weapon might be junk or even garbage, for example. You can't sell stuff for more than its listed price, unless the buyer is really desperate.

When characters loot a room or scavenge for supplies in the wilderness, they will often find junk. The GM will not always specify the type of junk found. In these cases the players can make up what they find. What they find should still make sense. In a bathroom you can find a mop, a bucket, a roll of toilet paper but you won't find plants or tires.

## Armor

Armor provides protection by reducing all incoming damage. A character can only wear one of each type of armor (body, head, shield). **Each Armor Point (AP) reduces incoming damage by 1.** Regular clothing doesn't offer protection and is considered Junk. Immediately after a fight where armor has been used to reduce damage, test quality or mark a notch on the item. Once, 3 notches are marked, the armor is considered destroyed and doesn't provide benefits anymore. Armor can be repaired, however.

| Armor  | Cost |  AP  | Example                                              |
| :----- | :--: | :--: | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| Body   |  30  |  1   | Leather Jacket, Animal Hides, Metal Cans, Tires.     |
| Head   |  20  |  1   | Bucket, Biker Helmet.                                |
| Shield |  15  |  1   | Car Door, Sewer Lid, Traffic Sign, Corrugated Metal. |

## Drugs & addiction

All drugs take effect immediately after they have been used and last for d6 blissful minutes. When the effect wears off, you get Disadvantage to all KNOW and PRES tests for the following hour. If any one drug is used more than once per day, a STAM test must be passed or the user becomes addicted. An addict must take one hit every 8 hours, or get disadvantage to all KNOW and PRES tests.

| d8   | Drugs      | Effect                                                       |

## Repairing

Sometimes items are used in ways that could break or deplete them. When faced with such a situation, roll a d4. If you roll a 1, the item is broken or depleted and can't be used again.

When rolling an attack roll of 20 with a weapon, roll for breakage. When rolling a 20 on a defensive roll, roll for breakage on each of your armor pieces that you wear. **An item can be repaired in a hour using Junk worth 1/4 its value and a succesful KNOW check.** If you fail, you lose the Junk and the item is still broken. Depending on the item, scrap or tech might be used, using their prices. If you dismantle a similar item to use its parts, you can ignore these costs.

## Crafting

When you want to craft something, collect enough Junk to match its price. For example, to craft heavy armor worth 60 Slugs, you must collect 60 pieces of Junk to be able to craft it. Depending on the item, scrap or tech might be used, using their prices. The component items should make sense and the player should describe how they use them. You can't make heavy armor out of glass and crayons. Spend 1 hour for every 5 Slugs of cost. Test KNOW every hour. If you fail, you do not progress with the crafting and lose the component items that you used in that hour. You can try again.
