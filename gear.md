# Gear

Equipment can be found throughout the world but can also be bought at settlements and wandering traders.

## Encumbrance

**A character can carry a number of items equal to their STAM with no issues.** Carrying more than this amount means they are encumbered and all attribute tests are rolled with Disadvantage - you can also only ever move to somewhere Nearby. A character simply cannot carry more than double their STAM.

## Slugs

Slugs are the standard currency. All prices are given in slugs. You can buy items for the listed price and sell them for half the listed price, rounded down. Slugs are also used as ammunition for most standard firearms.

## Equipment quality & degradation

When rolling an attack roll of 20 with a weapon, mark a Notch on the weapon. When rolling a 20 on a defensive roll, mark a Notch on each of your armor pieces that you wear. Depending on the equipment, it can be repaired by using Scrap or Junk and testing KNOW. A successful test removes one Notch for each Scrap/Junk used. Whenever equipment is used in ways that could harm it, test if you should mark a notch.

| :--: | :---------------: | :--: |
|  -   |  III - Destroyed  |  0   |
| 1-2  |    II - Shitty    | 1/3  |

## Junk & Garbage

Most things you scavenge are Junk. Junk might be useful in certain situations. A character can find a fair amount of junk lying around.

Garbage is worthless stuff. What counts as worthless varies by person. When you try to sell something, you might find that something is worth less for some traders. For a pacifist a weapon might be junk or even garbage, for example. You can't sell stuff for more than its listed price, unless the other party is really desperate.

When characters loot a room or scavenge for supplies in the wilderness, they will often find junk. The GM will not always specify the type of junk found. In these cases the players can make up what they find. What they find should still make sense. In a bathroom you can find a mop, a bucket, a roll of toilet paper but you won't find plants or tires.

## Armor

Armor provides protection by reducing all incoming damage. **Each Armor Point (AP) will reduce damage by 1.** Immediately after a fight where armor has been used to reduce damage, test quality or mark a notch on the item. Once, 3 notches are marked, the armor is considered destroyed and doesn't provide benefits anymore. Armor can be repaired, however.  The players are encouraged to describe the kind of armor the characters are wearing and what it's made of.
