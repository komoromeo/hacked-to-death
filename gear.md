# Gear

Useful items can be found throughout the world but can also be bought from traders or crafted.

## Encumbrance

**A character can carry a number of items equal to their STAM with no issues.** These are items that you need one hand to comfortably fit. Items that you need two hands for, occupy two slots. Really small items might be combined to occupy one slot or not counted against the weight limit. Carrying more than this amount means they are encumbered and all stat tests are rolled with Disadvantage - you can also only ever move to somewhere Nearby. A character simply cannot carry more than twice their STAM.

## Items

Bartering is common. The values of items are used when trading to assess the comparable values.

## Junk & Garbage

When characters loot a room or scavenge for supplies in the wilderness, they will often find junk. Despite the name, junk might be useful in certain situations. The GM will not always specify the type of junk found. In these cases the players should make up what they find. It should still make sense. In a bathroom you can find a mop, a bucket, a roll of toilet paper but you won't find plants or tires.

Garbage is worthless stuff. What counts as worthless varies by person. When you try to sell something, you might find that something is worth less for some traders. For a pacifist a weapon might be junk or even garbage, for example. You can't trade stuff for more than its listed value, unless the buyer is really desperate.

## Armor

Armor provides protection by reducing all incoming damage. A character can only wear one of each type of armor (body, head, shield). Each piece of armor provide some damage reduction (DR), subtract this from incoming damage. Regular clothing doesn't offer protection and is considered Junk. Immediately after a fight where armor has been used to reduce damage, test for breakage.

| Armor  | Value |  DR  | Example                                              |
| :----- | :---: | :--: | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| Body   |  30   |  1   | Leather Jacket, Animal Hides, Metal Cans, Tires.     |
| Head   |  20   |  1   | Bucket, Biker Helmet.                                |
| Shield |  15   |  1   | Car Door, Sewer Lid, Traffic Sign, Corrugated Metal. |

## Weapons

Remember, one shot with a pistol is one day's worth of food. The list here presents everyday items, more unique weapons will probably have unique rules.

| Weapons      | Value | Damage | Example                                     | Notes                                               |

## Fixing & Crafting Items

Sometimes items are used in ways that could break or deplete them. When faced with such a situation, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, the item is broken or depleted and can't be used again.

**An item can be fixed in an hour using items worth 1/4 its value and a succesful COMP test.** If you fail, you lose the components and the item is still broken. If you dismantle a similar item -- intact or broken -- to use its parts, you can ignore these costs.

**When you want to craft something, collect enough items that added together match its value.** This takes an hour and a succesful COMP test for every 5 value. If you fail, you do not progress with the crafting and lose the component items that you used in that hour. You can try again. The component items should make sense and the player should describe how they use them. You can't make body armor out of glass and crayons.
